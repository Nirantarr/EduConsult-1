              2. Description of Service
            </h2>
            <p>
              Tajpe is an online platform that connects students seeking academic and professional guidance ("Students") with qualified mentors and experts ("Mentors" or "Professors"). The Service includes, but is not limited to, mentor profiles, search and filtering tools, a communication platform (live chat, video calls), scheduling tools, and payment processing for sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tajpe acts as a marketplace and is not directly involved in the mentor-mentee relationship. We do not provide advice, tutoring, or mentorship services ourselves. We facilitate the connection between Students and Mentors, and our responsibility is limited to the functionality of the platform.
            </p>
